# Choice Helper

A simple AAC app designed to help children make choices between two-ish options.
Many children (especially with autism) use AAC devices to communicate. As a parent, I've often found myself
needing a tiny AAC device in my pocket. This app is meant to help.

## Features

- **Setup Screen**: Parents/caregivers enter two-four choices with labels and images
- **Choice Screen**: Large, tappable cards display the two options
- **Text-to-Speech**: Speaks the chosen word aloud when tapped (if phone not on silent mode)
- **Haptic Feedback**: Gentle vibration provides tactile response
- **Calming Design**: Soft colors and simple layout to reduce overstimulation
- **Offline Icon Library**: 850+ curated icons available without internet connection
- **Custom Images** You can upload any images of your own and organize them with categories

## Offline Functionality

The app includes a comprehensive offline icon library with 850+ pictograms specifically curated for children:

### Icon Library Structure

- **Standard Library (102 icons)**: Core curated icons for common choices (food, drinks, activities, feelings, etc.)
- **Extended Library (748 icons)**: Additional high-frequency words including:
  - Dolch Sight Words (Pre-primer through 3rd Grade)
  - Core AAC vocabulary
  - Common animals, foods, school items
  - Emotions and feelings
  - Body parts, clothing, transportation
  - Weather, colors, numbers, and time concepts

### Triple-Check Caching Strategy

When searching for icons:
1. **Bundled Icons First**: Searches the custom uploads and 850+ offline icons instantly
2. **Online Search**: If needed, searches 28,000+ additional ARASAAC icons online
3. **Auto-Cache**: Icons selected from online search are cached for future offline use

### Visual Indicators

- **Teal border**: Standard library icons (most curated)
- **Indigo border**: Extended offline library icons
- **Gray border**: Online-only icons (require internet)

## How It Works

1. On the setup screen, enter labels for two choices (e.g., "Chicken" vs "Fish")
2. Select images from the suggestions or use the default ones
3. Tap "Show Choices" to display the choice screen
4. The child taps their preferred option
5. The app speaks the word aloud with a gentle animation (phone can't be on silent mode)
6. Use the settings icon to return to setup and change choices

## Design Philosophy

- Large, clear visual targets for easy tapping
- Minimal UI to reduce cognitive load
- Soft, autism-friendly color palette (teal and coral)
- Clear text labels in large, readable font
- Consistent haptic and audio feedback
