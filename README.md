# Choice Helper

A simple, calming app designed to help children with autism make choices between two options.

## Features

- **Setup Screen**: Parents/caregivers enter two choices with labels and images
- **Choice Screen**: Large, tappable cards display the two options
- **Text-to-Speech**: Speaks the chosen word aloud when tapped
- **Haptic Feedback**: Gentle vibration provides tactile response
- **Calming Design**: Soft colors and simple layout to reduce overstimulation

## How It Works

1. On the setup screen, enter labels for two choices (e.g., "Chicken" vs "Fish")
2. Select images from the suggestions or use the default ones
3. Tap "Show Choices" to display the choice screen
4. The child taps their preferred option
5. The app speaks the word aloud with a gentle animation
6. Use the settings icon to return to setup and change choices

## Design Philosophy

- Large, clear visual targets for easy tapping
- Minimal UI to reduce cognitive load
- Soft, autism-friendly color palette (teal and coral)
- Clear text labels in large, readable font
- Consistent haptic and audio feedback
